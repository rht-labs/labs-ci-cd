# Jenkinsfile

Generally speaking, Jenkinsfile should live in the root directory of your application source code. Given that some of these Jenkinsfile run one time automation or reference apps that we are repurposing, it make sense to have the Jenkinsfile separate from the source.

This also allows us to use this repo for examples of Jenkinsfile.
