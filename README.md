# Open Innovation Labs CI/CD Bootstrapping
A collection of Red Hat Open Innovation Labs CI/CD components

## Overview
This is an inventory, some templates, some build projects, and associated configuration which can be used
to bootstrap a CI/CD environment in OpenShift Container Platform. Currently, this will deploy:

* CI/CD Project
* Dev/Test/UAT Environments
* Jenkins (With extra plugins and Docker build slaves)
* SonarQube (And associated PostgreSQL database)
* SonaType Nexus
* Maven Build Pod
* NPM Build Pod
* Example Java application and pipeline

## Prerequisites
* Ansible
* Ansible Galaxy
* OpenShift CLI Tools
* Access to an OpenShift cluster or [minishift](https://github.com/minishift/minishift)/[cdk](https://developers.redhat.com/products/cdk/overview/) environment

## Usage

1. Log on to an OpenShift server `oc login -u <user> https://<server>:<port>/`
    1. User needs permissions to deploy ProjectRequest objects
2. Clone this repository to `<workdir>/labs-ci-cd`
3. Modify the inventory under `<workdir>/labs-ci-cd/ci-cd-bootstrap/inventory/group_vars/all.yml` as required for site/customer specific needs
    1. Additional customization can be done in `<workdir>/labs-ci-cd/ci-cd-bootstrap/namespaces`
    2. Additional customization can be done in `<workdir>/labs-ci-cd/ci-cd-bootstrap/params`
4. Execute `./run.sh` in the `<workdir>/labs-ci-cd` directory. This will:
    1. Install the [casl-ansible](https://github.com/redhat-cop/casl-ansible) dependency in the current directory
    2. Execute the playbook `labs-ci-cd.yml` using the inventory contained in the current directory
